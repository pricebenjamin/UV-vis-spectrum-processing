# UV-vis-spectrum-processing

This repository contains several R-scripts that may prove helpful for processing UV-Vis spectra. Specifically, functions have been written to find and filter extrema found in absorption spectra, assign vibrational quantum numbers from values found in literature (for the iodine spectrum specifically), and adjust the resolution of the raw spectrum to better observe vibrational absorptions. Additional scripts are included for performing tasks such as plotting spectra (example below) or generating Birge-Sponer or second order plots from the processed spectral data.

The above spectrum was collected using an Ocean Optics HR4000 spectrometer: firmware 1.50.0; SN HR4C463.
